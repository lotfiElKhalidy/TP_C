## Compile and execute

> if the repo contains a `Makefile`:
- Run `make` to compile the files
> else:
- Run `gcc name_of_file.c -o prog -Wall -Wextra -g` to compile the file
> then:
- A file `prog` will be generated. To execute it, run `./prog`

## Debug

- Run `valgrind ./prog` to debug the file or any other debugger of your choice
